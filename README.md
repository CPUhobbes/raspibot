#Raspi-Bot
## A web controlled robot

### The app enables users to remotely control a Raspberry Pi robot.  It streams a live video feed so the user can move the robot beyond visual range.  Users can add and remove multiple robots under their account.

### Controls for the Raspi-Bot are W,S,A,D (UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT)

#### The app is built using React and React-Router. MongoDB was used as the database.
#### The robot is built using Python, RPi.GPIO, pymongo, and pygame (for sound).
